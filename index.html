    <p>My name is Miguel Martinez. I am inexpereienced in coding languages but am very intrested in them. However, I do have a good understanding
    of the hardware of computers and machines. My hope is to be able to find a career that heavily involves these two passions.
    I hope to have good semester with everyone.</p>
